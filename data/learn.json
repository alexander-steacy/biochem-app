It is an oxygen independent process and is the major source of energy for the brain. There are two phases in glycolysis, the energy investment phase and the energy return phase. In the first phase, two molecules of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) are added to the glucose molecule to form high-energy bonds. In the second phase, the energy return phase, the Gibbs free energy released from the high-energy bonds are used to produce two molecules of the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<span class=”superscript”>+</span>) and four molecules of ATP. Once glycolysis is complete NADH must be regenerated in order to continue successive rounds of glycolysis."},
