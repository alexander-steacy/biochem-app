			<h2>About the BioChem App</h2>
			<p>The purpose of this app is to create a place where students can come and interact with the material in several different ways. Students will be able to learn from videos, slideshows, text, graphics, interactives, and quizzes. Each of these different features is aimed at allowing students to work through the material in a way that best suits their learning.</p> 

			<p>In future iterations of the app, sutudents will be able to challenge each other and submit content that they created as part of their learning. Additionlly, there will be built in randomization features to make the quizzes appear in different orders and with different problem sets.</p>

			<p>In the current version there are two different topics that have been built to a limited extent. On topic centered around the amino acids provides students with a slideshow to click through and learn the different R groups of the amino acids. Along the way they will be taught about the type of amino acid, whether it is non-polar, basic, acidic or neutral polar. In the metabolism section, only glycolysis has been elaborated on, but their is a chose your own adventure feature that walks through the ten steps of glycolysis and teaches about how it is regulated and where decision points are made. It attempts to engage students by getting them to think about the different features of the cycle and what implications differnet scenarios have on glycolysis.</p>

			<p>Quizzes are forthcoming</p>
